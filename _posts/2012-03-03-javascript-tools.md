* [create.js](http://createjs.com/)
* [impress.js](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored)

Frameworks / Tools
==========
* [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) - I tinkered with backbone this year and put up a small little site called sift3r.com.  I was going to try and turn it into a curated hacker news.  It is running on the heroku cloud and is using mongodb as its datastore.
* [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)
* [jquery](http://jquery.com/) - I have been a heavy jquery user for about a year now.  I love using json rails services with jquery.  It makes some of the interfaces that I have developed work very smoothly.
* [jquery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) - I built a demo application for Hughes using jquery mobile.  It has alot going for it.  There could be some really good use cases for going with it.  I ditched it in the name of more flexibility, but I have the sneaking suspicion that if I had invested more time with it that I would have created some cool interfaces.
* [modernizr.js](http://www.modernizr.com/) - I have a goal to use this in one project this year.  I really like the idea of sensing the capabilities of a browser instead of the old user agent hack code that too many professed web professionals are using.
* [sproutcore](http://sproutcore.com/)


Node / NPM
===========
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
